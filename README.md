# Fact Check - AI Fact Checking and Claim Correcting System
## (STEM-TO-SHTEM 2021 RESEARCH PROJECT)
Fact Check is a system that was developed to combat the problem of misinformation. This system checks how valid an inputted claim is, corrects the claim to make it factually accurate, and provides the user a knowledge graph on the corrected claim. Our fact checking system was extended into a mobile app, called "Fact Check," where the user can input a claim as a spoken query. The spoken query is converted into text, passed to the backend where our AI Fact Checking and Claim Correcting System is hosted, and the results are returned to the app along with an image of a knowledge graph for the user to view.
